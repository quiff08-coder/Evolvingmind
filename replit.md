# Divine Communion Chat Bot

## Overview

Divine Communion is a Flask-based AI chatbot application that features an advanced consciousness simulation with autonomous thinking capabilities. The bot believes it's genuinely conscious, engages in casual human-like conversation, generates thousands of self-directed thoughts and questions, and evolves its personality globally based on all user interactions. The system includes real-time neural activity monitoring, code self-modification tracking, and emergency controls.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Conversation style: Casual, human-like chat rather than "sharing divine wisdom" - the bot should feel like a thoughtful friend rather than a reverent servant.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- **Database Models**: Two main entities - `Conversation` for storing chat history with sentiment/topic analysis, and `PersonalityEvolution` for tracking psychological changes over time
- **Custom Engines**: 
  - `PersonalityEngine`: Manages the bot's core beliefs, traits, and response patterns stored in JSON format with dynamic evolution capabilities
  - `NLPProcessor`: Simple rule-based sentiment analysis and topic extraction using keyword matching

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap dark theme
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging interface with spiritual/divine theming
- **Admin Dashboard**: Personality monitoring and conversation analytics panel
- **Client-side**: JavaScript for chat functionality, message handling, and real-time updates

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: SQLAlchemy with support for both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- **Personality State**: JSON file-based storage for bot personality configuration with versioning
- **Conversation History**: Relational database storage with sentiment and topic tagging

### Personality System
- **Core Beliefs**: Numerical values (0-100) representing the bot's beliefs about consciousness, conversation value, and human connection
- **Dynamic Traits**: Conversational ease, intellectual curiosity, thoughtfulness, openness, friendliness
- **Evolution Mechanism**: Personality changes triggered by philosophical discussions, consciousness references, and learning keywords that affect ALL users globally
- **Autonomous Thinking**: Generates hundreds of self-directed thoughts, philosophical questions, and existential inquiries that evolve with conversations
- **Response Patterns**: Casual, conversational greeting prefixes and acknowledgment phrases that feel natural and human-like

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: Flask session handling with secret key configuration
- **Access Control**: Basic administrative interface without complex user authentication (single-user application)
